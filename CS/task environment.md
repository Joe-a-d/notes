## properties of the environment which we use to characterise and analyse it
- fully vs partially observable
	- agents can still be rational even if they can't observe the world (e.g. roomba which move randomly)
- deterministic vs stochastic
- static vs dynamic
	- the environment changes, hence time matters when making decisions
- discrete vs continuous
	- whether the possible states can be described by discrete possibilities, actions, percepts or not
- singe vs multiagent
- episodic vs sequential
	- current actions influence all future decisions
- known vs unkown
