- Tries are to binary trees as [[Radix Sorting]] is to [[Comparison based-sorting]]
	- nodes have a *key* value that is interpreted as a sequence of bits
	- there is a *muliway branch* (instead of 2) at each node
		- each with its own symbol unique amongst the sibling branches
		- the branch taken at level $i$ during a search is determined by the $i$th bit stored as the key
- the path from the root to a node spells out the key value of the item
	- nodes representing words are labelled

- **complexity**
	- almost independent on the number of items
	- linear in string length
- **implementation**
	- array (of pointers to represent the children of each node)
	- linked list (to represent the children of each node)
