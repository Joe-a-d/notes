- defns of AI as it pertains to behavior Vs reasoning/thinking. 4 approaches
	- measured w.r.t humans vs ideal performance measure -> rationality

### Acting Humanly (Behavior + Human Level)

- this perspective comes directly from [[Turing]] when he developed his now famous [[Turing Test]].  In order for a machine to pass the test it needs to have the following capabilities:
	1.  [[NLP]] - for comms
	2.  [[knowledge representation]] - to store knowledge
	3.  [[automated reasoning]]  - to draw insights from stored info
	4.  [[ML]] - to adapt and extrapolate patterns
	5.  [[Computer Vision]] - perception
	6.  [[Robotics]] - movement
-  these essentially form all fields within AI
	-  5,6 are strictly speaking not required to passed the test as Turing conceived of it, but are relevant to the [[Turing Test#^4d94db|Total Turing Test]]
-  [[according to Russel and Norvig AI researchers do not put their focus on passign the turing test]]
