# Questions

- Should kernel sizes and number of layers be seen as an hyperparameter optimisation task?
	- Not really necessary. Also

# Topics discussed
- how to calculate input dimensions from layer to layer
	- the effect of kernel and pooling layers
- help debugging 
- admin : marking scheme, in particular w.r.t the professional conduct 
- the shift towards smaller kernels and deeper networks ^81f9b9
	- reduce the number of weights, but still achieves similar accuracy
