# Progress since [[Minute_2021-10-01]]
- started a couple of courses on DL
- looked into pyTorch
- collected papers on interpretability of networks

# Blockers


# Questions

- Is attempting to implement a NN from scratch without a framework feasible?
	- educational but not recommended
- How deep into digital processing do I need to go
	- Datasets like PanNuke work well out of the box
	- scikit-image should be enough for basic pre-processing

# Topics discussed

- Interpretability of the networks
	- Interim results, activation layers
	- Yosinki , 2015
	- occlusion masks
	- Visualisation
		- t-SNE
		- Grad-Cam
- LeNet MNIST character, 1998
- the role of convolutional kernels -> produce image (activation)
